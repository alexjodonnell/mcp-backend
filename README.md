# Miner
Algorithm for the 2018 Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC). Uses K nearest neighbors (KNN) clustering in combination with prospecting reports from a remote API in order to locate asteroids. Once a set of centrods are found denoting an asteroid is found, a mining hub is deployed to the location where the most ore is predicted. This corresponded to the centroid from KNN that has the most ore assigned to it.

**Go Team 2**
This solution placed second at CEC in 2018. Our team was ironically called Team 2.
